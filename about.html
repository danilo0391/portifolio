                I am a dynamic and driven individual with a business degree and an MBA in Strategic Business Management. My insatiable 
                thirst for knowledge led me on a captivating journey into the world of programming. Now, I am pursuing a higher diploma 
                in Science in Computing at CCT College Dublin, diving into coding and software development. My passion for study knows no 
                bounds, and I'm always seeking new challenges to stay at the forefront of technology. Besides academia, I love music, which 
                provides me with creative expression and relaxation. Transitioning to the IT industry excites me, and I'm eager to embrace new 
                opportunities and make a positive impact on businesses and individuals. With an open mind and a passion for learning, I am fully
                prepared for this thrilling new chapter in my professional life.
